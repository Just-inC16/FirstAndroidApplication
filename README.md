## Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
1. I struggled with the syntax. 
   a. I am not familiar with Kotlin.
   b. I am not familiar with Android namespace XML tags. But after understanding the file structure and syntax, I was more comfortable working in the environment.
2. I struggled with navigating to the next activities. 
3. I had trouble with loading the calendar and fetching the values from the field.
4. I had trouble placing the individual components in the correct positions.
